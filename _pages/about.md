I am a researcher curious about capturing how complex systems in biology and physics evolve in space and time.

I am currently doing my PhD with the Brain Modelling group at QIMR Berghofer, and Optical Micromanipulation Group at the University of Queensland. I am investigating how wave models can describe brain activity, with aims of describing pathology and treatments with non-invasive stimulation techniques. 

Previous to this, I completed my Bachelor of Advanced Science (Physics) at the University of Queensland where I am grateful to have explored a wide variety of projects in laser physics, machine learning, electrophysiology, critical phenomena, and neuroscience. From 2021-2023, I was employed to perform modelling for the COVID-19 epidemic, and fortunate enough to work alongside scientists and government to inform policy.    

I have a passion for tutoring, and have worked at the University of Queensland since 2019. I have tutored practical laboratories and coding, along with more traditional mathematics and physics classes. My approach is to provide a curiosity-led classroom, and inspire students to engage with their studies. I have also worked privately with primary and high-school students, specializing in neurodivergence education, and extension.

An example of my current work on cortical eigenmodes is below:
